**Studio Alight** is a creative collective formed with the aim to practice together a series of encounters and interactions alighting the invisible. Currently, we are exploring the crossroads of the arts, the law and the technological potential that both forms and misinforms our society.  The collective is based in Gothenburg, Sweden and currently lands in a long term artist residency with the ICIA, at Järnhallen on Ringön.  The collaborating creatives within the alighted team are the following individuals: Anna Bloch, Fredrik Garneij, Samantha Hookway, Christofer Kanljung, Anton Svensson and Alexander Wingård.
