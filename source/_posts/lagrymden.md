_Lagrymden_ is Studio Alightâ€™s first successful visualisation of the connections between the paragraphs of the law of Sweden. It provides an understanding of these connections between the lines that fills the lawbooks and is an experience that alights the gravity of the connections between the paragraphs.

While navigating inside the law of Sweden, the users of this map have noted that it both enables them to dare to navigate their own way through the paragraphs and exposes the complexity in its construction.
